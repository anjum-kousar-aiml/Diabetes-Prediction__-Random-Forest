# Diabetes-Prediction__-Random-Forest
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes using the Random Forest algorithm. It covers the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions for classification tasks. It is known for its robustness, ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality, and effectiveness in reducing overfitting. The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and demonstrates the practical application of the trained model for making predictions. Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided to assess model performance. Required packages include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
